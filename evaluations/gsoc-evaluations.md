Google Summer of Code has three evaluations. Here are evaluation notes from my mentors [Jared Watts](https://github.com/jbw976/) and [Travis Nielsen](https://github.com/travisn)
## First Evaluation
### Mentor (Travs Nielsen) Notes:
Rohan is self driven, motivated, and engaged with me as a mentor and with the project overall. He has taken the lead on driving the prototype and design of the project and asking for feedback, without being pressed for his progress. He takes the time to investigate a full solution and understand the big picture, which has helped the design converge and be approved on schedule and with the right approach. His attention to detail and patience to see the solution get to high quality has been beneficial to the project. His schedule has been very flexible to accommodate the schedule of mentors and the team despite being on the other side of the globe, once again demonstrating his dedication to this project. Integrating more into the community would help Rohan expand his knowledge of the entire Rook project and the scenarios required by the community. While he has focused on his individual project, he would benefit by more broadly participating in other user issues or pull requests. Note that this engagement should not take away from his ability to deliver, but with some small amount of time it could grow his perspective on cloud-native architecture.

## Second Evaluation
### Mentor (jbw976) Notes:
Rohan has done an excellent job on digging into the implementation phase of the project and demonstrated high proficiency with the relevant technologies such as Kubernetes, container runtimes, operators, golang, etc. He has continuously published his progress to a public work in progress pull request so the community can stay updated on the implementation of the feature and provide feedback. The scope of Rohan's efforts has also been fairly comprehensive with full user guides, examples and documentation to accompany the technical implementation of the feature. The mentors have given him guidance on some of the key design decisions as we have all learned more about the feature together during the iteration process, but he has done a lot of the implementation effort very independently, especially the debugging and troubleshooting work to get the feature working correctly. We are impressed with how much Rohan has been able to investigate and resolve on his own to unblock himself. We have provided the feedback that he should engage the mentors more proactively to help remove obstacles more quickly which he has started to do as he has been pushing recently to get the solution running and functional. We would suggest that Rohan continue to become more involved with the greater Rook community as a whole. He has some hesitation on jumping into the general discussions and questions amongst the greater community, but we believe he would be an asset there with some more effort. This would not only benefit the community, but also provide Rohan with a more well rounded and diverse experience in this technology space that will help him grow and mature as an engineer.
